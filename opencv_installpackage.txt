Some notes for installing VScode/Python/opencv/numpy (I'm using Windows)
This is a MUST if you don't want to get in troubles:
- 1. Always include python and VSCode in your PATH variable, unless VSCode and Python interpreter can't regconise each other.
- 2. I've wasted my time trying to install VSCode and Python in other drives like D drive, but it can't work with install opencv or numpy package.
=> You have to install it in default drive in your PC

For installations: open cmd => cd to Python's Scripts dir => install there. The packages are included in the Path variable then your VSCode can recognise them
If you install openCV => You'd better install this instruction: pip install 
--upgrade pip
pip install opencv-python
